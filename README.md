# vst24pas

vst2.4 for pascal

The pascal implementation of VST 2.4

You can use it to develop a vst2 plugin with lcl or vcl for win32, win64 and even native linux. Though in linux is not stable.

I recommend not use lcl if you want to build linux plugin.

Limited to my level, there may be bugs.

## install and use

Both fpc and delphi are supported.

Hint:

- FPC 3.2.0 and 3.3.1 are tested.

- Delphi 10.3.3 community is tested.

Please see examples.
